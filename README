CS283 Final Project
Natalia Pacheco-Tallaj and Toby Satterthwaite

The following external packages are used and must be installed in order to run our code:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Pillow
- scipy
- scikitlearn
- matplotlib

We present our final project in the form of a single Jupyter notebook (CS283 Final Project.ipynb). In order to reproduce our results, simply step through the notebook's cells. It is important to re-run the second cell, however, before running each of the final three cells which test the model on different inputs.

A small subsample of the data set has been included in the "ExtendedYaleB" directory. The entire data set can be torrented from: http://vision.ucsd.edu/~iskwak/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html
